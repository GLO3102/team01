Last season, House and Cuddy finally decided to take their relationship to the next level, but struggled to find a balance between their professional and personal lives, and ultimately, Cuddy made the very emotional decision to end their relationship. As each of them dealt with the aftermath of the break-up, House got married to an immigrant in need of a Green Card. In the series' milestone 150th episode, Thirteen was released from prison after euthanizing her brother who was suffering from the late stages of Huntington's Disease, the same disease with which she is afflicted. As the season comes to a close, when House's attempts to mend his relationship with Cuddy fall short, he's compelled to take drastic and possibly irrevocable measures that could forever change the course of their relationship."

Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney.  On a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes.  The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalski completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the darkness.  The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth…and any chance for rescue.  As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left.  But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.",

This magical cinematic event finds Kansas farm girl Judy Garland (\"A Star is Born,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis\") caught in a tornado and magically transported to the Land of Oz. Needing help to return home, she is told to follow the Yellow Brick Road and find the powerful Wizard (Frank Morgan). On her perilous journey, she is befriended by the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), the Tin Man (Jack Haley), and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who help her battle the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) and her flying monkeys. Based on the classic book by Frank L. Baum, \"The Wizard of Oz\" is a dazzling motion picture achievement, featuring unforgettable songs (including Oscar-winner \"Over the Rainbow\"), scenery, and costumes. The film had 5 Academy Award nominations, and Garland was awarded a special Oscar for her outstanding performance.",
